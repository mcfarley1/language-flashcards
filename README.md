# language-flashcards
Language-learning flashcards featuring German, French, Spanish, and Italian, covering six levels based on frequency of word use, using Python.  Press "Set Language and Level" to choose language and level.  "Introductory" is simply an abbreviated "Beginner 1" list.  "Comprehensive" is a complilation of all levels.  Once a selection is made, press "Save" to save your choices and exit the selection window, or you can cancel and exit the selection window by pressing "Cancel".

To begin showing flashcards, press "Begin".  A word will appear in the foreign language you chose, then after three seconds, the meaning in English will appear.  If no langauge or level selections were made upon initial opening of the app, Introductory German is the default.  If you answered correctly, press the green check mark to remove the word from the cards available so you will not be shown that word again.  If you answered incorrectly, press the red cross to keep the word in the stack of cards so that it may be shown to you again.

If you prefer to see the word in English first followed by the foreign language, press "Reverse" and begin again.

Once you have answered all of the words correctly, you will be notified to either reset your progress or select a new level.  You may reset your progress at any time by pressing the "Reset Progress" button, which will restore all words to the card stack.  You may also change your language and/or level at any time by pressing the "Set Language and Level" button.
